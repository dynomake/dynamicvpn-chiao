## | `DynamicVPN Chiao`
It's common module for my pet-project (DynamicVPN). I called it `chiao` because at some point I say "why not?"

### | `Add as depend:`
I guess it's info only for me, but okay:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "clojars.org"
        url = uri("https://repo.clojars.org")
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.dynomake:dynamicvpn-chiao:0.0.1'
}
```
